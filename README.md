We report a section-wide NLRome for the tuber-bearing section Petota of Solanum, containing the most important non-cereal food crop potato. Elucidation of diveristy and evolutionary trajectories of integrated domains provide promising candidates for identifying novel host targets of pathogens. Evolutionary genomics and functional analyses facilitate the discovery of new resistance genes showing borad-spectrum recognition and resistance to the late blight pathogen. These results will accelerate resistance introgression and/or stacking in hybrid potato breeding and our methodology also enlightens how NLRome discovers the knowns from the known unknowns of resistance gene repertoire in other crop species.
