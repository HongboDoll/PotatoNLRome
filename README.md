# PotatoPanNLRome
We report a section-wide pan-NLRome for the tuber-bearing section Petota, including the most important non-cereal food crop potato. Evolutionary genomics and functional analyses discover new late blight-resistant genes, presenting potential for resistance introgression and/or stacking in hybrid potato breeding. These results will accelerate the potato resistance breeding and our methodology also enlightens the construction of pan-NLRome in other crop species.
